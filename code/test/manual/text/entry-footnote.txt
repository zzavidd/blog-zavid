I didn't intend to write any of this. What I actually wanted to speak about was how I feel I've stepped from excellence to mediocrity this week and why I'm anticipant for what's to come in my life having escaped the pressures of excellence and being liberated into the freedom of simply existing.

I was swayed enough to listen to a podcast episode by [Joseph Solomon](https://www.google.com/search?q=joseph+solomon+instagram&oq=joseph+solomon+inst&aqs=chrome.0.0i457j69i57.3610j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) today which [Gbemi](https://www.instagram.com/gbemisola_obolo/) brought up during yesterday night's catchup relating to this very topic.

Earlier I mentioned our idea of purposes being related to our personal goals. I'm actually delivering a presentation to the rest of my church's youth group about that tomorrow evening at 5pm over Zoom.
